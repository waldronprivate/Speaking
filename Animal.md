Animal that u like or dislike
=============================

What?
When?
Where?
Why?

I`d like to introduce one of my favourite animal magpie, which is a common bird around my neighbourhood. When I was a child, I usually climed up to the tree and saw them directly. I thought they were so cute. But when i began my campus life, I can rarely see them because I lived in the dormitory then.

Actually, megpie is an auspicious bird, which means when you saw them, something good would happen on you. My grandfather firmly believed in that.
