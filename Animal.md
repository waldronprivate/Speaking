Animal that u like or dislike
=============================

What?
When?
Where?
Why?

I`d like to introduce one of my favourite animal called magpie, which is a common bird around my neighbourhood. When I was a child, I usually climed up to the tree and saw them directly. They were so cute. But when i began my campus life, I can rarely see them because I lived in the dormitory then.
Megpies around my home are black and white bird, which had two white wings and belly while the other parts are all black. It had a long tail and a lovely tummy. It feels so comfortable when I touch its tummy so if I had the channce on the weekend after school, I would still climb up to the trees to touch them.
Actually, there are lots of story and meaning of megpies. Seriously, my grandfather firmly believe in that megpie is an auspicious bird, which means when you saw them, something good would happen on you.
