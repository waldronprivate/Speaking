Magazines or Newspaper

What?
When?
How?
Why?
I`d like to share one of my favourite magazine called Light Music, which actually is a book about RnR music all over the world, and I`m a big fan of one of its columnwhich always introduce some rock stars and bands in the western country. I read it regularly when I was in high school and often shared it with my friends.
Once I was so impressed when I read about Green Day and one of their famous song "Wake me up when Semptember ends" which is a heart breaking song about a couple separated by the war and the fiance died in the battle field. It became one of my favourtie song after then. 
This magazine provided me so many fantastic songs such as <In the end> by Linkin Park, <I don`t love u> by My Chemical Romance. In one word, the reason I was fassinated about this music magazine was that it informed me so many great songs all over the world. What`s more, when sharing this magazine, I got lots of friends who shared the mutual interest in listening to RnR music. Now, when I feel stressed, there are so many songs to choose to release myself. That`s all I want to talk about Light Music.
