Song
====

I'd like to mention one of my favourite song called Wake Me Up When September Ends which is a typical American Pop Music, and I'm a big fan of this band called Green Day.

Well, I firstly heard this song when I was in high school and it's been almost 7 years since then and I still like it. Well, actually this band is quite famous in America called Green day and they sing a lot of cool music and classical songs. And their voice is very sexy and powerful and with their charming voice, it acutally can heal a lot of people that are broken heart.

And also, there is a part of lyrics impress me so much when they sing "Wake me up when September ends" because it's a song about a really sad story which a couple was separated because of the war and the fiance actually get killed during the war and the sweet lovers were, u know, they would never get channce to see each other again between the live and death. 

Anyway, I have to say this song was totally inspire me which means we should always mantain the peaceful life we have now and sometimes when I listen to the music, I always feel relax and it can release my presure after a long day's study. And, even, you know, I made a couple of friends because they are all big friends of Green days and their music as well. That's everything I wanna talk about this.
