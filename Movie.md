Movie
=====

1. What?
I'd like to share one of my favourite movie called Great Gatesby, which is a typical Hollywood tragedy movie, and I'm a big fan of Lionardo Dicaprio. 

2. When?
Well, I watched this movie when I was in my university, with my best friend at a Movie theater. 

3. How?
There are two leading actors and actresses, who are great gatesby, and also his long lost lover in the teenagehood, and it's a story about heart-broken thing that a couple was separated because of the War when they were young and finally managed to find each other after a long time. And then, there is a part of the plot that impress me so much that it's when Gatesby manage to make the fortune, he offered a lot of things to the girl. She roll over in the pile of clothes, all the fancy cloth and jewellery. That's the moment I feel like she got way more attractive by the processions and the practical thing and lost herself in the venity but not gatesby's love. 

4. Why?
In a word, I have to say, it's a great movie with the visual as well as awesome audio effect, and also with the special effect, the actually, somehow, paint us a picture of how old America, how pro used to be in long island. Besides, I enjoy the different atmosphere in the movie theatre because it was always quiet, and I can enjoy my snack like pop-corn, siting there and drinking some co-la, not doing anything just lost myself or emerge myself in the movie and it's, just a great place for me and my friends to hang out.
