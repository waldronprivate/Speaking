Sport
=====

I'd like to introduce one of my favourite sport called basketball, which is a contact and competitive sport and I'm crazy about it. 

Well, actually I started to play this game when I was in my primary school like 6 years old, and it's been almost fifteen years and I still still practise regularly once a week.

When I start to play this game, I need to prepare a lot of equipment such the very comfortable shoes, clothes, and, kneecap because I need to protect my knee. During the process, because I'm always in the center farward, so I would be keeping an eye on our rivals' attack and analyse it and inform my teenplayers to block them. Besides, I also enjoy playing in the team in my school because we are good friends and we enjoy hanging out together, especially when we won. 

In a word, I have to say, playing basketball is definately benefit my life in a good way because I can keep fit, and when I stress out from study, I can always release my presure by playing basketball. And also, through basketball, I got a channce to make more friends and when we won the game, I have a great sense of achievement.
