What?
"I'd like to introduce one of my favourite oil painting called Japanese Tree which is a typical realistic oil-painting and I'm a big fan of the fantastic artist, Phillippe Sainte-Laudy."

When?
"Well, I firstly saw a copy when I was in my university's gallery and it's been almost a year since then and I still love it."

How?
"Well, it's size of 47 by 30 inches, in the shape of retangle and it's in a piece."
"This paint is most about a tree that are shined in the sunset with red leaves and there are peaceful air around it. All this painting give me a sense of quiet."
"Its function was to expend our eyesight to the art of the world, which is said by our Art teacher, and when I got stress out after a day's study, it can release my presure. Besides, it gives me a sense of feeling art."

Why?
"In a word, it's one of the most fantastic oil painting I have seen, which can improve my sense of art. And also, I always feel relax when I saw it. That's all I want to talk about Japanese Tree."
