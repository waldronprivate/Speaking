###Neighbour
#####How can u keep a good relationship with your neighbours?
The most important thing to keep a good relationship with my neighbours is to keep in touch with them. When I go shopping, I would ask them if I could buy something for them in passing. Sometimes we may hang out together in our spare time. 

#####Do u think it's important to get along well with your neighbour?
Yes, I do. I mean neigbhours who live close to us is way important than relatives lives far away.

#####What is the difference between friends and neighbours?
The biggest difference is that we can pick our friends and keep in touch with them. But we can't choose our neighbours and most of which are only hi-backs.

#####What would you do if your next-door neighbour were noisy nearby all the time?
I would ask them to tune the volume down directly. I think it was the most effective way in solving this kind of problem. Also, leaving notes and letters is also a good way especially when I want to keep the distance.

###Relatives
#####Do you have many relatives?
Yes I do. I have a bunch of relatives. My grand-parents have two sons and two daughters, and all of them have at least one child. As you can see, I have many cousins. Though I am the only child in my immediate family.

#####When you are a child, which of relatives did you see most often?
According to me, my cousin, the daughter of my father's brother, was with me the most often. We used to hang out a lot and travel together. Unfortunately, she emigrated ten years ago. I couldn't forget the farewell that I woke up at 6 and rushed to the airport to see her off.
