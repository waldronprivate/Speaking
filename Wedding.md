Wedding
=======

#####What?#####
"I'd like to mention a personal experience, a wedding of my aunty, which is a typical Western style wedding, and I still remember some plots of it."

#####When?#####
"I attended this wedding when I was at eleven or twelve, with my parents and other relatives in a restaurant."

#####How?#####
"What I remembered only was that the bridgeroom walked out with the best man and waited for his bride, my aunty. My aunty walked out a few minutes later and they kissed in front of the priest. Then they changed the vow and announced to start the party."
"There is a part of the wedding that impress me so much that it's when my father arrived there he suddenly found out he forgot to bring any gifts so he went to my mom for help, who was also search for my father because of the same issue. When they finally meet in the middle of the hall and soon understood what had happened, they looked like they wanted to dig a hole and hided there."

#####Why?#####
"In a word, I have to say, it's the only wedding I attended to, so all the impression about wedding were left by that. It's a ceremony passed from generation to generation and it's important to the couple. Besides, I have to mention that at that age, I was interested in joining the party and ate plenty of good food, It was certainly a good time to satisfy my appetite."
