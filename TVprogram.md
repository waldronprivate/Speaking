What?
"I would like to share one of my favourite TV program called Daily Show in Comedy Center which is a typical America talk show and I`m a big fan of one of the hosts, Stephen Colbert. "

When?
"I started to watch this show when I was in my university when I was scanning though the twitter and it was recommanded in one tweets. That's the moment I started to watch the show." 

How?
"This show is mainly about mocking some social situation and even some celebrities and interview about famous people. There's one part of the show impress me so much when he said the news about the private issues of famous people was 'the news that reporters spent their career life not to be able to do this' which is a great mock on those unbehavior paparazii. It's hilarious for me."

Why?
"In a word, it's a great talk show program. I love it because Colbert make my life happier and he always give me a good mood after hearing his comment on celebrities and this is the time I practise my listening and talking as well, the way he talk is a regular speed for American which benefits my English study."
