TV program

What?
When?
How?
Why?

I would like to share one of my favourite TV program called Daily Show in Comedy Center which is a typical America talk show and I`m a big fan of one of the hosts, Stephen Colbert. I began to watch this show last year when I was hanging out on the twitter and this show was recommanded on my friend`s tweets. I clicked the link to watch it. It was the first time I saw Stephen Colbert, who was mocking about a redicurous law on that clip. I laughed from the begining to the end of this clip and I thought: Jesus, he is such a funny and brilliant man!
Comedy Center was like a news program, the hosts usually are in suits and pretend to brocast a piece of news, which actually are some ridicurous story that they would laugh at. Those stories are some unreasonable government or organization behavior that do harm to some others.
Among the hosts in this show, Colbert`s speech was straight away, funny but thought-providing. What impressed me most is that he described the news of private issues of famous people were the news that every reporter "waste their entire career not to be able to report on", which mocks the behavior of the crazy paparazzis. I could not agree more. Well, that`s all I want to talk about Colbert.
